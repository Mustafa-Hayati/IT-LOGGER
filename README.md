# IT LOGGER

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this app using [Brad Traversy's](https://github.com/bradtraversy/) REACT FRONT TO BACK 2019 course . This is a IT LOGGER app created with **React**, **react hooks**, **redux** and **json-server**

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
3. To run frontend, open command line and run `npm start`. It will run on port 3000.
4. To run backend. open a new tab in your command line and run `npm run json-server`. json-server will run on port 5000.
